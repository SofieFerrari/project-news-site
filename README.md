The Brainstorming Project!
The assingment is to create a site with information. I tackled this by making a website about the process in which the brainstorming was the focus!

The problem
I started out steching the boxmodel on paper but moved on to Figma instead. It gave me a better over view. I then asked my friends using Instagram stories to help me figure out a topic for me to design my website about. I then forked the project and cloned it to VScode using the terminal and added my images to the file.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
