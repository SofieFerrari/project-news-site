The Brainstorming Project!
The assingment is to create a site with information. I tackled this by making a website about the process in which the brainstorming was the focus!

The problem
I started out scetching the boxmodel on paper but moved on to Figma instead. It gave me a better over view. I then asked my friends using Instagram stories to help me figure out a topic for me to design my website about. I then forked the project and cloned it to VScode using the terminal and added my images to the file.
I first completed the project using mostly flexbox and grid for my "news articles" but after talking to a teammember I tried doing the project with grid as my layout and flexbox for small things. I then, after creating two sites, commited to the grid based, but with more flexbox and I have come to the conclusion that I would hav used flexbox on nearly everything and grid on the "instagram-pic" and "brainstorming-button" if I could redo it. However time is up!
